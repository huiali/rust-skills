# Rust Coroutine Skill

Use this skill to solve Rust tasks in this domain with actionable, production-ready guidance.

## Focus Areas
- Model suspend/resume control flow clearly
- Integrate with async/task runtimes safely
- Prevent state corruption across yields

## Workflow
1. Define coroutine state transitions
2. Implement suspension boundaries
3. Integrate cancellation/error paths
4. Test resumability and ordering

## Typical Triggers
- coroutine, generator, suspend, resume

## Output Expectations
- Provide compilable Rust snippets when code is requested.
- Explain tradeoffs and list assumptions.
- Include concrete verification commands (`cargo check`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`) when relevant.

## Localized Reference
- Original Chinese content is preserved in `SKILL_ZH.md`.
