# Rust Unsafe Skill

Use this skill to solve Rust tasks in this domain with actionable, production-ready guidance.

## Focus Areas
- Audit unsafe blocks for soundness
- Minimize unsafe surface area
- Document invariants explicitly

## Workflow
1. State safety invariants
2. Encapsulate unsafe internals
3. Enforce safe public API
4. Validate with tests and code review

## Typical Triggers
- unsafe, raw pointer, soundness

## Output Expectations
- Provide compilable Rust snippets when code is requested.
- Explain tradeoffs and list assumptions.
- Include concrete verification commands (`cargo check`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`) when relevant.

## Localized Reference
- Original Chinese content is preserved in `SKILL_ZH.md`.
