# Rust Web Skill

Use this skill to solve Rust tasks in this domain with actionable, production-ready guidance.

## Focus Areas
- Build robust HTTP APIs
- Design middleware and error responses
- Integrate DB/cache/auth safely

## Workflow
1. Define API contract and routes
2. Implement handlers and state management
3. Add middleware and error mapping
4. Validate with integration tests

## Typical Triggers
- web, axum, actix, http, rest, api

## Output Expectations
- Provide compilable Rust snippets when code is requested.
- Explain tradeoffs and list assumptions.
- Include concrete verification commands (`cargo check`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`) when relevant.

## Localized Reference
- Original Chinese content is preserved in `SKILL_ZH.md`.
