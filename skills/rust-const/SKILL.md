# Rust Const Skill

Use this skill to solve Rust tasks in this domain with actionable, production-ready guidance.

## Focus Areas
- Use const generics for stronger invariants
- Move checks to compile time where practical
- Keep generic APIs ergonomic

## Workflow
1. Identify compile-time invariants
2. Encode with const generics/traits
3. Validate error ergonomics
4. Benchmark overhead reduction

## Typical Triggers
- const, const generics, compile-time

## Output Expectations
- Provide compilable Rust snippets when code is requested.
- Explain tradeoffs and list assumptions.
- Include concrete verification commands (`cargo check`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`) when relevant.

## Localized Reference
- Original Chinese content is preserved in `SKILL_ZH.md`.
