# Rust Distributed Skill

Use this skill to solve Rust tasks in this domain with actionable, production-ready guidance.

## Focus Areas
- Design reliable cross-service workflows
- Handle partial failures and retries
- Preserve idempotency and observability

## Workflow
1. Model failure modes and SLAs
2. Define communication and state strategy
3. Implement retries/timeouts/idempotency
4. Validate under fault injection

## Typical Triggers
- distributed, consistency, retry, consensus

## Output Expectations
- Provide compilable Rust snippets when code is requested.
- Explain tradeoffs and list assumptions.
- Include concrete verification commands (`cargo check`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`) when relevant.

## Localized Reference
- Original Chinese content is preserved in `SKILL_ZH.md`.
