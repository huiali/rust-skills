# Rust Error Handling Skill

Use this skill to solve Rust tasks in this domain with actionable, production-ready guidance.

## Focus Areas
- Replace panic-style paths with recoverable errors
- Design meaningful error enums
- Improve debugging context

## Workflow
1. Separate expected vs unexpected failures
2. Define error types and conversion paths
3. Propagate with ?
4. Cover failures with tests

## Typical Triggers
- result, option, panic, error handling

## Output Expectations
- Provide compilable Rust snippets when code is requested.
- Explain tradeoffs and list assumptions.
- Include concrete verification commands (`cargo check`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`) when relevant.

## Localized Reference
- Original Chinese content is preserved in `SKILL_ZH.md`.
