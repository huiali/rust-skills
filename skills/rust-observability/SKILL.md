# Rust Observability Skill

Use this skill to solve Rust tasks in this domain with actionable, production-ready guidance.

## Focus Areas
- Instrument critical paths first
- Keep logs structured and safe
- Use bounded-cardinality metrics

## Workflow
1. Define telemetry goals
2. Add tracing/logging/metrics
3. Export and verify telemetry
4. Tune dashboards and alerts

## Typical Triggers
- tracing, metrics, otel, prometheus

## Output Expectations
- Provide compilable Rust snippets when code is requested.
- Explain tradeoffs and list assumptions.
- Include concrete verification commands (`cargo check`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`) when relevant.
