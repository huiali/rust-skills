# Rust Ecosystem Skill

Use this skill to solve Rust tasks in this domain with actionable, production-ready guidance.

## Focus Areas
- Compare alternatives quickly
- Assess maintenance risk and adoption
- Recommend stack combinations by scenario

## Workflow
1. Define constraints and non-goals
2. Shortlist candidate crates
3. Evaluate tradeoffs and compatibility
4. Recommend default and fallback options

## Typical Triggers
- crate selection, framework choice, ecosystem

## Output Expectations
- Provide compilable Rust snippets when code is requested.
- Explain tradeoffs and list assumptions.
- Include concrete verification commands (`cargo check`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`) when relevant.

## Localized Reference
- Original Chinese content is preserved in `SKILL_ZH.md`.
