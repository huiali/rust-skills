# Rust Resource Skill

Use this skill to solve Rust tasks in this domain with actionable, production-ready guidance.

## Focus Areas
- Guarantee cleanup under failure
- Choose pooling vs direct ownership models
- Reduce leaks and handle exhaustion safely

## Workflow
1. Model resource acquisition/release
2. Encode ownership and cleanup
3. Handle retries and fallback behavior
4. Stress-test lifecycle edges

## Typical Triggers
- resource management, pool, lifecycle

## Output Expectations
- Provide compilable Rust snippets when code is requested.
- Explain tradeoffs and list assumptions.
- Include concrete verification commands (`cargo check`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`) when relevant.

## Localized Reference
- Original Chinese content is preserved in `SKILL_ZH.md`.
