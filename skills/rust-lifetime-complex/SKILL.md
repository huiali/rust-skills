# Rust Complex Lifetime Skill

Use this skill to solve Rust tasks in this domain with actionable, production-ready guidance.

## Focus Areas
- Resolve non-trivial borrow/lifetime errors
- Design APIs with advanced trait bounds
- Balance flexibility and usability

## Workflow
1. Minimize to failing generic case
2. Model lifetime relationships explicitly
3. Refactor bounds and ownership
4. Re-test call-site ergonomics

## Typical Triggers
- hrtb, gat, lifetime, trait bounds

## Output Expectations
- Provide compilable Rust snippets when code is requested.
- Explain tradeoffs and list assumptions.
- Include concrete verification commands (`cargo check`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`) when relevant.

## Localized Reference
- Original Chinese content is preserved in `SKILL_ZH.md`.
