# Rust eBPF Skill

Use this skill to solve Rust tasks in this domain with actionable, production-ready guidance.

## Focus Areas
- Build safe eBPF programs and loaders
- Design map/event schemas correctly
- Respect verifier constraints

## Workflow
1. Define probe/hook strategy
2. Implement eBPF program and map usage
3. Build user-space integration
4. Validate verifier and runtime behavior

## Typical Triggers
- ebpf, kernel, map, probe, tail call

## Output Expectations
- Provide compilable Rust snippets when code is requested.
- Explain tradeoffs and list assumptions.
- Include concrete verification commands (`cargo check`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`) when relevant.

## Localized Reference
- Original Chinese content is preserved in `SKILL_ZH.md`.
