# Rust Cache Skill

Use this skill to solve Rust tasks in this domain with actionable, production-ready guidance.

## Focus Areas
- Choose cache-aside/write-through patterns
- Avoid stale data and thundering herds
- Tune TTL and key design

## Workflow
1. Classify read/write patterns
2. Define key schema and invalidation
3. Implement with observability
4. Load-test consistency and latency

## Typical Triggers
- cache, redis, ttl, invalidation

## Output Expectations
- Provide compilable Rust snippets when code is requested.
- Explain tradeoffs and list assumptions.
- Include concrete verification commands (`cargo check`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`) when relevant.

## Localized Reference
- Original Chinese content is preserved in `SKILL_ZH.md`.
