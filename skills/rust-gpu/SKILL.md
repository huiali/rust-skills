# Rust GPU Skill

Use this skill to solve Rust tasks in this domain with actionable, production-ready guidance.

## Focus Areas
- Design efficient GPU memory access
- Coordinate kernels and synchronization
- Measure throughput and utilization

## Workflow
1. Model compute/data pipeline
2. Minimize transfer overhead
3. Tune kernel and launch configuration
4. Benchmark and validate correctness

## Typical Triggers
- gpu, cuda, shader, compute

## Output Expectations
- Provide compilable Rust snippets when code is requested.
- Explain tradeoffs and list assumptions.
- Include concrete verification commands (`cargo check`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`) when relevant.

## Localized Reference
- Original Chinese content is preserved in `SKILL_ZH.md`.
