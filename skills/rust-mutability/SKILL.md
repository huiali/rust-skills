# Rust Mutability Skill

Use this skill to solve Rust tasks in this domain with actionable, production-ready guidance.

## Focus Areas
- Resolve mutable/immutable borrow conflicts
- Choose interior mutability primitives safely
- Keep APIs explicit about mutation

## Workflow
1. Identify mutation scope
2. Select the right mutability primitive
3. Minimize shared mutable state
4. Validate with tests

## Typical Triggers
- mut, refcell, cell, borrow conflict

## Output Expectations
- Provide compilable Rust snippets when code is requested.
- Explain tradeoffs and list assumptions.
- Include concrete verification commands (`cargo check`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`) when relevant.

## Localized Reference
- Original Chinese content is preserved in `SKILL_ZH.md`.
