# Rust Skill Index

Use this skill to solve Rust tasks in this domain with actionable, production-ready guidance.

## Focus Areas
- Map user requests to the most relevant Rust sub-skill
- Provide quick lookup by topic and error type
- Reduce misrouting and context overhead

## Workflow
1. Identify the primary problem type
2. Select one or two best-fit skills
3. Escalate to specialized skills for edge cases
4. Return a concise next action plan

## Typical Triggers
- skill index, directory, routing
- which rust skill should I use

## Output Expectations
- Provide compilable Rust snippets when code is requested.
- Explain tradeoffs and list assumptions.
- Include concrete verification commands (`cargo check`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`) when relevant.

## Localized Reference
- Original Chinese content is preserved in `SKILL_ZH.md`.
