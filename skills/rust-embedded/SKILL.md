# Rust Embedded Skill

Use this skill to solve Rust tasks in this domain with actionable, production-ready guidance.

## Focus Areas
- Build reliable no_std systems
- Handle interrupts and shared state safely
- Optimize memory and startup footprint

## Workflow
1. Define target and constraints
2. Set up no_std/HAL stack
3. Implement ISR-safe architecture
4. Validate on hardware/simulator

## Typical Triggers
- embedded, no_std, isr, risc-v, wasm

## Output Expectations
- Provide compilable Rust snippets when code is requested.
- Explain tradeoffs and list assumptions.
- Include concrete verification commands (`cargo check`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`) when relevant.

## Localized Reference
- Original Chinese content is preserved in `SKILL_ZH.md`.
