# Rust Linear Type Skill

Use this skill to solve Rust tasks in this domain with actionable, production-ready guidance.

## Focus Areas
- Enforce single-use resource flows
- Encode lifecycle states in types
- Prevent leaks and invalid transitions

## Workflow
1. Define resource state machine
2. Encode transitions in types
3. Eliminate invalid operations
4. Validate drop and recovery paths

## Typical Triggers
- linear type, raii, resource lifecycle

## Output Expectations
- Provide compilable Rust snippets when code is requested.
- Explain tradeoffs and list assumptions.
- Include concrete verification commands (`cargo check`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`) when relevant.

## Localized Reference
- Original Chinese content is preserved in `SKILL_ZH.md`.
