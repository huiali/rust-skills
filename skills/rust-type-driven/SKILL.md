# Rust Type-Driven Skill

Use this skill to solve Rust tasks in this domain with actionable, production-ready guidance.

## Focus Areas
- Move rules into types and traits
- Prevent invalid states by construction
- Balance expressiveness with ergonomics

## Workflow
1. Identify domain invariants
2. Encode invariants in types
3. Design conversions/builders safely
4. Validate API usability

## Typical Triggers
- type-driven, phantom, typestate, invariants

## Output Expectations
- Provide compilable Rust snippets when code is requested.
- Explain tradeoffs and list assumptions.
- Include concrete verification commands (`cargo check`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`) when relevant.

## Localized Reference
- Original Chinese content is preserved in `SKILL_ZH.md`.
