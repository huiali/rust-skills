# Rust Macro Skill

Use this skill to solve Rust tasks in this domain with actionable, production-ready guidance.

## Focus Areas
- Build maintainable macros
- Improve compile-time diagnostics
- Keep generated code readable and safe

## Workflow
1. Define macro input/output contract
2. Implement parsing and generation
3. Add useful compiler errors
4. Test expansion scenarios

## Typical Triggers
- macro, proc-macro, derive

## Output Expectations
- Provide compilable Rust snippets when code is requested.
- Explain tradeoffs and list assumptions.
- Include concrete verification commands (`cargo check`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`) when relevant.

## Localized Reference
- Original Chinese content is preserved in `SKILL_ZH.md`.
