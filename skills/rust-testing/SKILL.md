# Rust Testing Skill

Use this skill to solve Rust tasks in this domain with actionable, production-ready guidance.

## Focus Areas
- Design robust and deterministic tests
- Improve failure diagnostics
- Keep test suites fast and maintainable

## Workflow
1. Classify failure type
2. Select test strategy
3. Write deterministic assertions
4. Run CI-friendly validation

## Typical Triggers
- cargo test, proptest, loom, criterion

## Output Expectations
- Provide compilable Rust snippets when code is requested.
- Explain tradeoffs and list assumptions.
- Include concrete verification commands (`cargo check`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`) when relevant.
