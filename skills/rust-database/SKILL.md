# Rust Database Skill

Use this skill to solve Rust tasks in this domain with actionable, production-ready guidance.

## Focus Areas
- Design safe persistence boundaries
- Tune transactions and query performance
- Keep migration strategy reliable

## Workflow
1. Define data consistency requirements
2. Implement data access layer
3. Add migration and rollback strategy
4. Validate under load and failures

## Typical Triggers
- sqlx, diesel, sea-orm, transaction, migration

## Output Expectations
- Provide compilable Rust snippets when code is requested.
- Explain tradeoffs and list assumptions.
- Include concrete verification commands (`cargo check`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`) when relevant.
