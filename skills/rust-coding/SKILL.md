# Rust Coding Standards Skill

Use this skill to solve Rust tasks in this domain with actionable, production-ready guidance.

## Focus Areas
- Improve readability and maintainability
- Standardize naming/module conventions
- Apply clippy/rustfmt best practices

## Workflow
1. Review public API and module structure
2. Refactor for clarity and cohesion
3. Apply lint/format checks
4. Add concise docs and tests

## Typical Triggers
- style, naming, clippy, rustfmt

## Output Expectations
- Provide compilable Rust snippets when code is requested.
- Explain tradeoffs and list assumptions.
- Include concrete verification commands (`cargo check`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`) when relevant.

## Localized Reference
- Original Chinese content is preserved in `SKILL_ZH.md`.
