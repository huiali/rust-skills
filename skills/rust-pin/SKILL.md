# Rust Pin Skill

Use this skill to solve Rust tasks in this domain with actionable, production-ready guidance.

## Focus Areas
- Explain pinning invariants
- Implement pin-safe APIs
- Avoid invalid self-references

## Workflow
1. Identify movement constraints
2. Choose Pin/Unpin strategy
3. Implement projections safely
4. Verify invariants in tests

## Typical Triggers
- pin, unpin, self-referential, future

## Output Expectations
- Provide compilable Rust snippets when code is requested.
- Explain tradeoffs and list assumptions.
- Include concrete verification commands (`cargo check`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`) when relevant.

## Localized Reference
- Original Chinese content is preserved in `SKILL_ZH.md`.
