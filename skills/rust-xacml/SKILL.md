# Rust XACML Skill

Use this skill to solve Rust tasks in this domain with actionable, production-ready guidance.

## Focus Areas
- Model policies and decisions clearly
- Separate policy evaluation from business logic
- Ensure explainable deny/allow outcomes

## Workflow
1. Define subjects/resources/actions
2. Implement policy evaluation pipeline
3. Integrate enforcement points
4. Test policy edge cases

## Typical Triggers
- xacml, policy, rbac, permission

## Output Expectations
- Provide compilable Rust snippets when code is requested.
- Explain tradeoffs and list assumptions.
- Include concrete verification commands (`cargo check`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`) when relevant.

## Localized Reference
- Original Chinese content is preserved in `SKILL_ZH.md`.
