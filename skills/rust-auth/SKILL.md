# Rust Auth Skill

Use this skill to solve Rust tasks in this domain with actionable, production-ready guidance.

## Focus Areas
- Design secure auth flows
- Validate tokens and claims correctly
- Protect routes and service boundaries

## Workflow
1. Define auth model and threat surface
2. Implement token parsing/verification
3. Apply middleware/guards
4. Test auth and failure paths

## Typical Triggers
- auth, jwt, token, api key

## Output Expectations
- Provide compilable Rust snippets when code is requested.
- Explain tradeoffs and list assumptions.
- Include concrete verification commands (`cargo check`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`) when relevant.

## Localized Reference
- Original Chinese content is preserved in `SKILL_ZH.md`.
