# Rust DPDK Skill

Use this skill to solve Rust tasks in this domain with actionable, production-ready guidance.

## Focus Areas
- Optimize packet path latency/throughput
- Use lock-free and NUMA-aware designs
- Control memory and queue behavior

## Workflow
1. Define packet processing pipeline
2. Tune queues/mempools/core pinning
3. Reduce contention and copies
4. Benchmark under realistic traffic

## Typical Triggers
- dpdk, packet, numa, low latency

## Output Expectations
- Provide compilable Rust snippets when code is requested.
- Explain tradeoffs and list assumptions.
- Include concrete verification commands (`cargo check`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`) when relevant.

## Localized Reference
- Original Chinese content is preserved in `SKILL_ZH.md`.
