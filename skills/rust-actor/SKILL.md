# Rust Actor Skill

Use this skill to solve Rust tasks in this domain with actionable, production-ready guidance.

## Focus Areas
- Design actor boundaries and protocols
- Manage mailbox backpressure
- Handle supervision and restart policies

## Workflow
1. Define actor message contracts
2. Implement mailbox and handlers
3. Add supervision/failure strategy
4. Test ordering and throughput

## Typical Triggers
- actor, mailbox, supervision

## Output Expectations
- Provide compilable Rust snippets when code is requested.
- Explain tradeoffs and list assumptions.
- Include concrete verification commands (`cargo check`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`) when relevant.

## Localized Reference
- Original Chinese content is preserved in `SKILL_ZH.md`.
