# Rust Async Pattern Skill

Use this skill to solve Rust tasks in this domain with actionable, production-ready guidance.

## Focus Areas
- Orchestrate task lifecycles safely
- Coordinate services with graceful shutdown
- Structure plugin/worker pipelines

## Workflow
1. Define orchestration model
2. Implement task supervision
3. Handle failure propagation
4. Verify shutdown semantics

## Typical Triggers
- tokio::spawn, orchestration, async pattern

## Output Expectations
- Provide compilable Rust snippets when code is requested.
- Explain tradeoffs and list assumptions.
- Include concrete verification commands (`cargo check`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`) when relevant.

## Localized Reference
- Original Chinese content is preserved in `SKILL_ZH.md`.
