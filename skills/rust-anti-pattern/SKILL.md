# Rust Anti-Pattern Skill

Use this skill to solve Rust tasks in this domain with actionable, production-ready guidance.

## Focus Areas
- Detect unnecessary clone/unwrap patterns
- Simplify overly complex type/trait usage
- Fix async/concurrency misuse

## Workflow
1. Spot anti-pattern symptoms
2. Replace with idiomatic alternatives
3. Measure impact
4. Guard with lint/tests

## Typical Triggers
- anti-pattern, clone, unwrap, smell

## Output Expectations
- Provide compilable Rust snippets when code is requested.
- Explain tradeoffs and list assumptions.
- Include concrete verification commands (`cargo check`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`) when relevant.

## Localized Reference
- Original Chinese content is preserved in `SKILL_ZH.md`.
