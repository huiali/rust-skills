# Rust Zero-Cost Skill

Use this skill to solve Rust tasks in this domain with actionable, production-ready guidance.

## Focus Areas
- Preserve performance while improving API quality
- Avoid hidden allocations and dynamic dispatch costs
- Use compiler-friendly abstraction patterns

## Workflow
1. Inspect generated cost model
2. Refactor abstraction boundaries
3. Benchmark before/after
4. Keep interfaces maintainable

## Typical Triggers
- zero-cost, abstraction, allocation, overhead

## Output Expectations
- Provide compilable Rust snippets when code is requested.
- Explain tradeoffs and list assumptions.
- Include concrete verification commands (`cargo check`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`) when relevant.

## Localized Reference
- Original Chinese content is preserved in `SKILL_ZH.md`.
