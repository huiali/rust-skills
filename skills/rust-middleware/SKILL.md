# Rust Middleware Skill

Use this skill to solve Rust tasks in this domain with actionable, production-ready guidance.

## Focus Areas
- Compose middleware with predictable ordering
- Prevent cross-cutting regressions
- Keep latency overhead low

## Workflow
1. List cross-cutting concerns
2. Define middleware order
3. Implement and benchmark overhead
4. Validate with integration tests

## Typical Triggers
- middleware, cors, rate limit, tracing

## Output Expectations
- Provide compilable Rust snippets when code is requested.
- Explain tradeoffs and list assumptions.
- Include concrete verification commands (`cargo check`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`) when relevant.

## Localized Reference
- Original Chinese content is preserved in `SKILL_ZH.md`.
