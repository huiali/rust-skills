# Rust FFI Skill

Use this skill to solve Rust tasks in this domain with actionable, production-ready guidance.

## Focus Areas
- Design safe FFI boundary APIs
- Handle memory ownership across languages
- Prevent ABI and panic/exception hazards

## Workflow
1. Define ABI contract
2. Wrap unsafe boundary in safe interface
3. Manage ownership explicitly
4. Test boundary behavior

## Typical Triggers
- ffi, c, c++, bindgen, abi

## Output Expectations
- Provide compilable Rust snippets when code is requested.
- Explain tradeoffs and list assumptions.
- Include concrete verification commands (`cargo check`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`) when relevant.

## Localized Reference
- Original Chinese content is preserved in `SKILL_ZH.md`.
