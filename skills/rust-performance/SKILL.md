# Rust Performance Skill

Use this skill to solve Rust tasks in this domain with actionable, production-ready guidance.

## Focus Areas
- Profile before optimizing
- Reduce allocation and copy overhead
- Improve cache behavior and parallel efficiency

## Workflow
1. Benchmark current behavior
2. Identify hot paths
3. Apply targeted optimizations
4. Re-benchmark and validate correctness

## Typical Triggers
- performance, benchmark, profiling, latency

## Output Expectations
- Provide compilable Rust snippets when code is requested.
- Explain tradeoffs and list assumptions.
- Include concrete verification commands (`cargo check`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`) when relevant.

## Localized Reference
- Original Chinese content is preserved in `SKILL_ZH.md`.
