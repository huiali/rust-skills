# Rust Async Skill

Use this skill to solve Rust tasks in this domain with actionable, production-ready guidance.

## Focus Areas
- Design robust async workflows
- Handle cancellation and timeouts correctly
- Prevent starvation and unbounded queues

## Workflow
1. Map async boundaries and ownership
2. Pick runtime primitives
3. Implement cancellation/backpressure
4. Validate with load and failure tests

## Typical Triggers
- async, await, stream, tokio

## Output Expectations
- Provide compilable Rust snippets when code is requested.
- Explain tradeoffs and list assumptions.
- Include concrete verification commands (`cargo check`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`) when relevant.

## Localized Reference
- Original Chinese content is preserved in `SKILL_ZH.md`.
